Welcome to my portfolio site. This is where my projects and experience are listed in order to demonstrate my capabilities to the world. This portfolio has 3 goals in mind

* Demonstrate Capabilities
* Provide Contact Mechanisms
* Serve as a Sandbox for Technologies I'm Learning

Feel free to peruse the app and even suggest changes through pull requests. The following technologies are used in this web app.

* Rails 4.0
* Ruby 2.0
* Turbolinks (now standard in Rails 4.0)
* JQuery

Future editions of this site may include frontend frameworks such as AngularJS
